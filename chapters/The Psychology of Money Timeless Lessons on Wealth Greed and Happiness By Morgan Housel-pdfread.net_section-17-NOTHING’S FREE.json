{"book_name":"The Psychology of Money Timeless Lessons on Wealth Greed and Happiness By Morgan Housel-pdfread.net","genre":"finance","chapter_id":15,"chapter_title":"NOTHING’S FREE","summary":"In Chapter 15, the author highlights that everything in finance comes with a price, often obscured until faced with reality. Using the example of GE's rise and fall, Housel illustrates that the apparent ease of success often masks underlying complexities. Investing demands paying a price—not always in dollars, but in emotional tolls like volatility and fear. Many investors inadvertently seek to avoid this 'fee,' which can lead to detrimental decision-making. Ultimately, recognizing market volatility as an admission fee rather than a punitive fine is crucial for long-term success in investing.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"A finance expert stands contemplatively in a bustling urban environment, illuminated by warm evening sunlight, with a color palette of #EDE4D9, #D2BBA0, and #1D1D1D.

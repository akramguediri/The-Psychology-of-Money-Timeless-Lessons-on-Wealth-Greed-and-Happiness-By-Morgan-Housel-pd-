{"book_name":"The Psychology of Money Timeless Lessons on Wealth Greed and Happiness By Morgan Housel-pdfread.net","genre":"finance","chapter_id":11,"chapter_title":"REASONABLE > RATIONAL","summary":"In this chapter, Morgan Housel challenges the notion that financial decisions must be made solely on rational, calculative principles. Instead, he emphasizes the importance of being reasonable—making decisions that humans can actually stick with long-term. Housel uses the historical example of Julius Wagner-Jauregg, who devised a controversial treatment based on the belief that fevers combat infections, to illustrate that what is rational on paper may not be reasonable in practice. He argues that financial strategies should cater to human emotions and instincts, ensuring lasting commitment. Ultimately, the chapter proposes that the foundation of successful investing lies in reasonable choices that resonate with our emotional and social realities.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"Human decision-making processes in finance, Thoughtful and introspective office ambiance, Soft and warm lighting, #F8F5F2 with #D2BBA0 and #3B3A3F, Reflective and serene, Modern realism, Digital art, Balanced composition, Smooth textures, 50mm lens","style":"Inspirational financial reflection","overlay_opacity":20,"blur_strength":10,"color_palette":["#F8F5F2","#D2BBA0","#3B3A3F"],"font_primary":"Aktura-Regular.otf","font_secondary":"CabinetGrotesk-Regular.otf","text_color":"#3B3A3F","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"Embrace Your Humanity in Finance","section_body":"You are not a robot; you are an emotional being.
